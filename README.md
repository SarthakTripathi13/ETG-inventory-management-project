Inventory Management 

# OVERVIEW
this project is related to inventory management of a small shop I have created this project to manage the goods for the shop using the power of python and json. This will save a lot of time and efforts of the shopkeepers.

# working
 Basically i have only added two functionalities in it: 
 # 1) Selling products to customers:
 it includes taking inputs from users and generating bills for them with the time and date of their purchase this project even tells them if we have the adequate stock ready for them or not. it displays items with their name price quantity and manufacturing date plus it also tells whether the product is in stock or not. it has the function that if the purchased items are available in inventory, only then Bill is generated . 
 # 2) Adding new stock to the inventory
 Here we can add new goods in the inventory and the records will be stored in records.json file.
 it includes adding new products to the inventory when stock vanishes we may add even time of arrival of stock too in it . Initially i added only 40 items in the stocks but by 
 adding this functionality anyone who uses this code has the ability to add many more itmes of his/her choice without actually accessing the records file.
